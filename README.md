# MIT EECS - 6.3 Computer Science and Engineering

This repo houses my journey of taking the courses listed as the curriculum for the MIT undergraduate program, [6-3: Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/curriculum/6-3-computer-science-and-engineering/). Each folder houses a git submodule of the course's repo, which contains the course's assignments and projects. The course's repo is linked below.

I've decided to do the assignments in my current favourite language, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) instead of the language the course uses.

# 6.100A Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python (6.0001)
